'''
An implementation of the Twitter analysis tool mentioned on
http://www.laurentluce.com/posts/twitter-sentiment-analysis-using-python-and-nltk/

happy.txt contains 80 tweets that are happy (positive),
sad.txt contains 80 tweets that are sad (negative).

happy_test.txt and sad_test.txt contains 10 positive
and 10 negative tweets respectively to test the
classifier.
